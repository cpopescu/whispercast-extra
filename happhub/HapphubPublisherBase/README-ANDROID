Just include the Android.mk here from the Android.mk of the native code your compiling.

The generated modules, to be consumed by the library's client:

LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES := libpublisherBase
LOCAL_SHARED_LIBRARIES := libavutil libavcodec libavformat libswresample libswscale

.. and don't forget to include the Android logging library:

LOCAL_LDLIBS += -llog
